## A collection of useful terminology

#### Aboveground biomass
The total mass of living matter above the ground is expressed as dry weight.
#### Agricultural crop
A plant that is grown and harvested for ecosystem benefits, profits or subsistence. This could be
fruit, medicinal plants, or nut plants.
#### Agrisilvicultural
An agroforestry system that mixes crops and trees, such as shade systems (like coffee with citrus
trees) or border planting.
#### Agroforestry
Land-use systems and technologies in which woody perennials (e.g. trees, shrubs, palms or
bamboos) and agricultural crops or animals are used deliberately on the same parcel of land in
some form of spatial and temporal arrangement. . Agroforestry practices, whether agrisilvicultural,
silvopastoral or agrosilvopastoral, should include a subsistence or medicinal component.
#### Agrosilvopastoral
An agroforestry system that integrates trees, crops and animals, such as home gardens involving
animals or woody hedges grown for fodder.
#### Baseline scenario
The most likely future scenario for land use and land management in a project area in the absence
of project intervention(s).
#### Belowground biomass
The total mass of living matter below the ground is expressed as dry weight.
#### Buffer Pool
Holds carbon credits that are left unsold as insurance against the risks of non-delivery and reversal
of Carbon Benefits. Projects shall set aside carbon benefits to the buffer pool for the duration of
the project to cover unforeseen premature loss of carbon stock.
#### Carbon baseline
Reflects the total carbon stock before the start of a project intervention.
#### Carbon benefit
An increase in carbon stock relative to the carbon baseline as a result of a project intervention.
#### Carbon pool
A system that can store and/or accumulate carbon.
#### Carbon stock
The quantity of carbon in a carbon pool.
#### Confidence interval
A type of estimate derived from the observed data gives the probability with which the estimated
interval will contain the true value of the parameter. It is a combination of the critical values.
#### Crediting period
The period in which carbon removals from the project intervention will be claimed.
#### Critical value
A factor is used to compute the margin of error. It is the value that splits the probability of
availability or rejection region, which includes or excludes the targeted value in an interval.
#### Diameter at breast height (DBH)
The measurement of the diameter of a tree at the height of 1.3 meters. For this methodology’s
purposes, DBH is measured in centimeters.
#### Ecoregion
A large area of land and/or water, ecologically and geographically characterized by distinct
ecosystems, flora, and fauna. Following the “terrestrial scheme” defined by the WWF3, which splits
the world’s land surface into 867 ecoregions.
#### Ground truth measurement
The manual measurement and counting of trees in a specific sample plot of land.
#### Heavy machinery
Machinery, such as tractors, that does not comply with regenerative agriculture due to high
emissions and significant use of non-renewable energy, excluding necessary hand-operated
machinery, such as chainsaws, that also require non-renewable energy.
#### Land property
An entire land property of the farmer (including roads, buildings, timber lots, etc.).
#### Leakage
An unintended reduction in carbon stocks or increase in t CO2eq emissions outside a project area,
as a result of project activities.
#### Native species
Plant or animal species that occur naturally within the project area and was not introduced as a
result of human activity.
#### Naturalized species
A non-native species that reproduce consistently and sustains populations over more than one
life cycle without direct human intervention.
#### Non-tree biomass
All non-woody living perennial biomass.
#### Plot
A discrete area of a smallholder’s property within which one or more project intervention(s) is
applied, excluding roads, buildings etc. Plots are defined by polygons and can have an extent
between 0.1 ha and 10 ha.
#### Project area
The total area that project interventions are applied to within a project region. A project will
include many individual plots of 0.1 to 10 ha in size, which combined make up the total project
area of the project.
#### Project intervention
A set of agroforestry activities designed based on scientific and local expertise to restore or
improve management of land, increase carbon storage or reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
which has a positive impact on local livelihoods and ecosystems.
#### Sample plot
An area of a maximum of 1 ha within a plot, in which trees are measured to estimate the groundtruth measurement of biomass for models.
#### Sample subplot
A sample subplot is a 25x25m area located within the sample plot. Established to make groundtruth measurement of biomass easier to execute.
#### Silvopastoral
An agroforestry system that combines trees and animals, such as cattle grazing in coconut groves.
#### Soil disturbance
Are referring to activities that result in a decrease in soil organic carbon e.g. ploughing, ripping,
scarification, digging of pits and trenches, stump removal etc.
#### Stratum
By default, this methodology defines a stratum based on a specific ecoregion. Where necessary,
further stratification can be done, e.g. based upon variety in pre-project tree biomass or project
activities. Sampling only takes place at the stratum (ecoregion) level and is not required on all
plots in the project area.
#### Synthetic fertilizer
Chemically derived fertilizer that is manufactured from minerals, natural gasses and inorganic
waste materials.
#### Tree
A woody perennial biomass that exceeds 2m in height or more than 2.5cm DBH.
