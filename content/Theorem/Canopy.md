- Canopy height models are a measurement of the height of trees, buildings, and other structures above the ground topography. 
- This product is used in a variety of forestry applications including tracking vegetation and trees in a forest over time, **calculating biomass**, and estimating leaf area index.
- A canopy height model is calculated by subtracting the digital terrain model (DTM) from the digital surface model (DSM). 
    - A DTM refers to the bare earth (ground surface)
    - DSM measures the elevation of the top of a landscape including vegetation and buildings.
