 ## Biomass 

 - Biomass is defined by FAO as the "mass of life" or "dead organic matter" (FAO/GTOS,2009)
 - It is generally measured in units **dry mass per area** (i.e. after removing the water) or units of **carbon per area** (usually tons/ha or Mg/ha)
 - Foest biomass includes mass of all parts of the tree so not only the trunk but also bark, branches, roots, needles or leaves.
