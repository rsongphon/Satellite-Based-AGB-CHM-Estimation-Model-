## Problem Assessment

##### Why we have this project?

 ![problemasset](/problemasset.png)

- Goals of this project is to create a models that can inference forest structure-related value such as aboveground biomass density , canopy height in given area by using only remote sensing data.​​

- Traditional field inventory methods reliably estimate forest stucture data but it has cost and time constraints, also low scalability.
