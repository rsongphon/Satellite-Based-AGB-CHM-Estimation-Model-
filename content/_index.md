## Overview. 

![concept](/concept.png)


This project is an UNET probabilistic deep learning model for estimating forest structure data such as canopy height/above ground biomass from satellite-based data such as sentinel 1 , sentinel 2 and GEDI data. 

Here you can find all relevant information about this project.
